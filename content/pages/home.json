We look to utilize our resources the best that we can. In the past few years we have reduced our building energy usage by 50%. All staff are bi-vocational to lower salary costs. We strive to deliver the maximum results for every dollar. \n\nFor the past twenty years, we have consistently given away nearly every penny we take in.  "
