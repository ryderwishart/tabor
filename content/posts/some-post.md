## Time: 10 AM every Sunday

Our Sunday morning worship gathering is a time for spiritual refreshing where we pray, sing and study the Bible together.  

This opportunity is ideal for someone new to the faith or more experienced.  

The emphasis on community allows you to be open to God's voice in an inviting and welcoming environment.
