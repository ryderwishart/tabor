## International Missions

The Lord has gifted us with a vision larger than just our city and we have involvement in Christian ministries on several continents.

To respond to this calling, every year a minimum of 50% of our budget, not dedicated to church planting, goes overseas.

In this calling we are honoured to meet and provide for humble servants of our God that daily sacrifice for His kingdom.
